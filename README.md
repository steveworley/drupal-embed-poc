# Drupal embed POC

Using GatsbyJS this connects to a Drupal site to retrieve content and provides a way to build markup using the consumed content which can then be embeded into other sites.

# Set up

You can set up the app by running.

```
git clone git@github.com:steveworley/drupal-embed-poc.git
npm install -g gatsby
npm install
gatsby develop
```

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8000/discovery

# Thanks
